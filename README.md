# Creating a Mailable
To create your own Mailable, utilize the Mailable base class. Here's how the Test class is structured:

```bash
namespace App\Mail;

use Illuminate\Bus\Queueable;
use Illuminate\Mail\Mailable;
use Illuminate\Mail\Mailables\Content;
use Illuminate\Mail\Mailables\Envelope;
use Illuminate\Queue\SerializesModels;
use Illuminate\Mail\Mailables\Address;

class Test extends Mailable
{
    use Queueable, SerializesModels;

    public function envelope(): Envelope
    {
        return new Envelope(
            subject: 'Checklist Message',
            from: new Address('jeffrey@example.com', 'Jeffrey Way'),
        );
    }

    public function content(): Content
    {
        return new Content(
            view: 'emails.send_report',
            with: ['data' => [], 'content' => []],
        );
    }

    public function attachments(): array
    {
        return []; // Return an array of attachments if necessary
    }
}
```
